# ARCOS â€“ AI Rule-Constrained Orchestration System

ARCOS is a schema-driven framework for orchestrating AI agents under strict
specification and validation rules. It defines how a Coordinator (Maestro)
interacts with Speculus, Producer, Validator, and Post-Processor agents,
with domain-specific schemas providing the business rules.

This repository publishes the **ARCOS schemas (XSD)**, example XML files,
documentation PDFs, and diagrams.

It also provides a stable URL base for referencing schemas in XML documents.
